## Installation step

This will download the repository files to your local directory.

2. **Navigate to the App Directory:** Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the app's directory by running the following command:

```
cd Coursefinity-Frontend
```

3. **Install Dependencies:** In the same console or terminal, run the following command to install the required dependencies for the React app:

```

```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed under the `"dependencies"` section.

4. **Start the Development Server:** After the dependencies are installed, run the following command in the console or terminal to start the development server and run the React app:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the React app in your default browser. If the app doesn't open automatically, you can access it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **View and Interact with the App:** You should now be able to view and interact with the React app in your browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically be reflected in the app as long as the development server is running.

6. **Stop the Development Server:** To stop the development server, go back to the console or terminal and press `Ctrl + C`. Confirm the termination if prompted.

These steps should allow you to run the Coursefinity React app locally and start developing or exploring its functionality. Feel free to modify the code, add new features, or customize the app to suit your needs.
